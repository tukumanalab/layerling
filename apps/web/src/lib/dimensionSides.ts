/**
 * The numbers on the edges of a body count along the workplane; its fields (width, depth, height)
 * count along its own sides. With a workplane on a face, and a body turned by a quarter, the two
 * differ: the number on the long edge belongs to the field called depth, not width (#419), and for a
 * body laid on its side the number on the vertical edge belongs to depth or width, not height (#480).
 * Returns the field a mark stands for and how a held edge (the signs of the handle, in the workplane's
 * frame) reads in the body's own frame - or null when the body does not lie along the workplane's
 * axes, where the mark is only the box round it and belongs to no single side.
