 * A body extruded from a sketch carries its exact CAD body as it was built.
 * Resized afterwards, only its mesh followed; the stored body was stretched on
 * demand, and stretching curved sides unevenly gives the kernel an invalid
 * solid ("The stored CAD feature could not be restored", #115). So a resized
 * sketch body is built again from its sketch, stretched to the new size -
 * lines and Bézier curves stay exactly what they were when stretched - and the
 * sketch keeps the size the body has, for the next time it is edited.
